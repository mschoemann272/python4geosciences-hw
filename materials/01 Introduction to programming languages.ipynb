    "All computer code is ultimately executed in 'assembly' language. These are the instructions that the CPU is designed to understand. The instructions are exectuted sequentially from a specified point in memory, and generally modify and move other parts of the computer's memory. Here is an example of 'Hello World' in assembly (from http://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/gasexamples/):\n",

    "Most scientific programming has traditionally been done in 'low level', compiled languages like [FORTRAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran), occassionally [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)). FORTRAN was developed in 1956, but the cannonical FORTRAN used in most scientific applications was developed in 1977, called FORTRAN 77; it is still in wide use today. Most 'high level' languages build off of C and FORTRAN libraries developed decades ago, like [LAPACK](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/). FORTRAN is easy to read, but must be compiled, and may be complicated for things other than straightforward mathematical array opperations. This example shows code used to solve a laplace transform:\n",

    "## Interpreted languages\n",
    "\n",
    "Most modern scientific analysis is done using 'high level' interpreted code. This type of language does not need to be compiled, but is rather interpreted (i.e., 'compiled' and converted to machine language) line by line. This allows users to either type code in interactively, or create a longer script or program that can be run all at once. The advantages of these high level languages are readability, flexibility, and compactness. For example, the nested loop above can be done in Python with:\n",
    "\n",
    "    u[1:-1, 1:-1] = ((u[0:-2, 1:-1]+u[2:, 1:-1])*dy2+\n",
    "        (u[1:-1, 0:-2]+u[1:-1, 2:])*dx2)*0.5/(dx2 + dy2)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also packages (in this case `scipy.ndimage.filters.laplace`) that will do the same operation as a function call. The primary disadvantage is that these languages are slow; most complicated programs that require speed (such as numerical weather prediction) still rely on FORTRAN. Generally, FORTRAN is about ten times faster than even optimized numerical python scripts (see [this comparison](http://scipy.github.io/old-wiki/pages/PerformancePython) of different methods used in speeding up pure python code.)\n"

    "All code will eventually be translated to machine language, commands that can be understood by the CPU. Computers are fundamentally digital, and represent all things using 32- 64- or 128- bit numbers. For example, a 32 bit representation of an integer is:\n",

    "    \n",

The standard way to do this is the [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point) floating point convention. Thus numbers are not stored exactly, but have a precision based on the number of bits used to represent the number. Typical precisions are 32 bit (single precision) and 64 bit (double precision). These numbers are computed as sign \\* $2^{exponent}$ \\* mantissa.\n",
